# Part #2: Application Overview


In this part, It is designed to allow us to focus on the key building blocks of Angular. By creating an app to display customer data and their orders, we will hone in on the key aspects of Angular, such as Components, Modules, Services and Routing. Also, during the course, we will learn about great features every app has, like sorting and 	filtering.

# Part #3: Angular CLI
In this part we learn the basics of using the Angular CLI (command-line interface) tool and walk through the basic commands:
  
```
ng --version   ng --help   ng new my-app-name   ng generate [component | directive | pipe | service | class | interface ng build    ng serve   ng lint    ng tests 
```

 

 
# Part #5: The Big Picture
Here we learn a useful abstraction that Components are similar to Lego blocks â€” we build up components and then use them to stick together to make an app. We also get a quick refresher on JavaScript language family and learn where TypeScripts 	ts in.
 
Dan gives us a good mental model to use for thinking about our code while working with Angular so we can imagine where it all 	ts in.
